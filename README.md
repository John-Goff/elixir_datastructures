# ElixirDatastructures

Some datastructure implementations in elixir, with an accompanying lesson plan for teaching these
structures (and Elixir itself) to beginners.

Note that this plan is scattered, follows my train of thought and probably shouldn't be heavily
relied on.

Thse datastructures have not been tested in a production envionment and you shouldn't use them for
anything important.

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `elixir_datastructures` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:elixir_datastructures, "~> 0.1.0"}
  ]
end
```

Documentation can be generated with [ExDoc](https://github.com/elixir-lang/ex_doc)
and published on [HexDocs](https://hexdocs.pm). Once published, the docs can
be found at [https://hexdocs.pm/elixir_datastructures](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir_datastructures).
